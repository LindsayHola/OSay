# On the way to learn optimization
So I am exploring how to optimizing parameters of some math models along the way I collect some useful tips.
## Math Modelling Repo with real world application
- Fit a stopping distance model by minimising squared error
## C Util Repo to do binary and denary conversion
- convert a base 10 number into a binary integer, and vice versa. 
- FOR STUDENTS: please strictly use this to ONLY verify your answers for homework and revision tasks
